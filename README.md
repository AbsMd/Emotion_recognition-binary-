# Emotion_recognition-binary-
Classify image features extracted from a grayscale image (using Openface) as surprise or not surprise. 
It can be applied to any other emotion.
We use the Genetic Algorithm to select the best chromosomes(feature combinations)
A neural network is trained to classify whether or not the features display surprise(class1) or not(class0)
The Neural Network accuracy is used as a fitness function for the GA algo with specific crossover and mutation
